# NOTE: the "Guest" table should actually be called "Guess" but I couldn't figure out how to deal with the irregular plural of "Guesses" when generating my migrations, so Guesses are now just called Guests
# The "conceptuser" table could--more semantically--be called the "Ratings" table.  It is where the ratings are stored; an intersection of particular users and particular concepts (where the user looks at a concept, decides about it, and makes a rating, which is stored in this table)
